## Building an application
The fastes way to build and deploy is using VM (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04). Use `install-kivy-buildozer.sh` to install all the dependencies.
Foolow the official docs for building. Small buildozer tipp: use the command `buildozed android debig deploy run logcat` while your android device is pluged in to run and debug the app.
